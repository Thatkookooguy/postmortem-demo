### TL;DR

Shakespeare Search down for 66 minutes during period of very high interest in Shakespeare due to discovery of a new sonnet.

### Impact

Estimated 1.21B queries lost, no revenue impact.

### Root Causes

Cascading failure due to combination of exceptionally high load and a resource leak when searches failed due to terms not being in the Shakespeare corpus. The newly discovered sonnet used a word that had never before appeared in one of Shakespeareâ€™s works, which happened to be the term users searched for. Under normal circumstances, the rate of task failures due to resource leaks is low enough to be unnoticed.

### Trigger

Latent bug triggered by sudden increase in traffic.

### Resolution

Directed traffic to sacrificial cluster and added 10x capacity to mitigate cascading failure. Updated index deployed, resolving interaction with latent bug. Maintaining extra capacity until surge in public interest in new sonnet passes. Resource leak identified and fix deployed.

### Detection

Borgmon detected high level of HTTP 500s and paged on-call.

### Lessons Learned

nope.
