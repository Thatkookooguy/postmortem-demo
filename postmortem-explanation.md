# Postmortem Explorer

A **project post-mortem** is a process, usually performed at the
conclusion of a project, to determine and analyze elements of the
project that were successful or unsuccessful. The [Project Management
Body of Knowledge] (PMBOK) refers to the process as [lessons
learned].[1] Project post-mortems are intended to inform process
improvements which mitigate future risks and to promote iterative best
practices. Post-mortems are often considered a key component of, and
ongoing precursor to, effective [risk management].[2]

Elements of a project post-mortem
---------------------------------

Post-mortems can encompass both quantitative data and qualitative data.
Quantitative data include the variance between the hours estimated for a
project and the actual hours incurred. Qualitative data will often
include stakeholder satisfaction, end-user satisfaction, team
satisfaction, potential reusability and perceived quality of
end-deliverables.

Role of time tracking
---------------------

Successful analysis of project estimate variance is dependent on
accurate time tracking. The greater the granularity with which time is
tracked, the more detailed an analysis can be performed during the
project post-mortem.
